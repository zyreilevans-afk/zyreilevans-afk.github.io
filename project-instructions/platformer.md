# Before You Start

## **Objective**

Get ready to bring your game design ideas to life! 🎮 In this project, you’ll design a playable level for a platformer game, using **JavaScript functions** to place platforms, collectables, and cannons that make gameplay exciting and challenging.

You’ll be learning to:

- **Call functions** with specific values (arguments) to position game elements precisely.
- **Think like a game designer** as you create a level that’s both fun and challenging for players.

By the end of this project, you’ll have built a custom game level that’s ready for action! Your level will include multiple platforms and collectables, and strategic cannons that keep players on their toes. Let’s get started and make something epic! 🚀

<br><br>

## **Requirements and Grading**

| Requirement                     | Description                                                   | Points |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Create at least 5 platforms** | Platforms should be placed strategically throughout the game  | 30     |
| **Add 3 collectables**          | Place collectables at various positions using different types | 30     |
| **Add 3 cannons**               | Place cannons on different sides with varying delays          | 30     |
| **Design a playable level**     | Create a level that’s challenging but achievable              | 10     |

<br><br>

## **Functions Recap**

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You “call” a function to run the code inside it. Many functions require inputs, known as **_arguments_**, which are the specific values the function uses to perform its task.

---

### Key Terms

<div style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">

| Term              | Definition                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Function Call** | Code that runs the function and gives it any necessary inputs (arguments).                             |
| **Arguments**     | The actual values you pass into the function when you call it (e.g., `500` for x in `createPlatform`). |
| **Parameters**    | Placeholders in the function definition that represent the values needed to perform the task.          |

</div>

---

### Example

For example, calling `createPlatform(500, 300, 200, 20);` means:

- **500 and 300** are the x and y coordinates where the platform will appear.
- **200 and 20** are the platform’s width and height.

These numbers are **arguments** passed to the function, matching the **parameters** defined in the function.

# Lesson Steps

## **Work Flow: How to Navigate Through the Lesson Steps**

🎯 **Goal:** Learn how to follow the steps in this lesson to build and customize your game one step at a time.

---

### Step-by-Step Work Flow

1. 📂 **Open the `platformer.js` file** in your codespace to get started.
   - 🔍 Locate the file tree (the list of files and folders) in the left panel of your codespace.
   - Click the `fsd-projects` folder 📂 in your file tree expand the list of projects.
   - Click on the `platformer` folder 📂 located within the `fsd-projects` folder.
   - Click on the `platformer.js` file. Coding for all steps will be done in this file.
2. **Follow the instructions carefully** for each TODO:

   - Pay attention to where new code should be added.
   - Only code inside the designated areas
     - Make sure all function calls go between the _`ONLY CHANGE BELOW THIS POINT`_ and _`ONLY CHANGE ABOVE THIS POINT`_ comments.

3. 🖥️ **Preview your game regularly using Live Server** to see how your changes affect the game level.

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- **After each TODO**, double-check your code to ensure it matches the examples.
- If you encounter issues, **preview your site** using Live Server to troubleshoot.

<!-- 4 line breaks between TODOs -->
<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 0: Preview Your Site with Live Server**

🎯 **Goal:** Preview your site in the browser to see how it looks and behaves as you make changes.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

There are two ways to open your project with **Live Server**:

#### **Option 1: Right-Click Method**

1. 📂 **Find the `index.html` file** in the file tree on the left side of your codespace.
2. **Right-click on `index.html`** and select **“Open with Live Server.”**

#### **Option 2: Go Live Button in the Bottom Panel**

1. **Look at the bottom-right corner** of your codespace.
2. **Click the “Go Live” button** to launch Live Server.

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

## **TODO 1: Enable the Grid**

🎯 **Goal:** Enable the grid in your game to see the x and y coordinates in 100-pixel increments.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Uncomment the `toggleGrid` function**

   - **Find the `toggleGrid()` line in your JavaScript file**. You’ll see it has `//` at the beginning, making it inactive.
   - Remove `//` to enable the grid in your game.

2. **Check your game in Live Server**

   - Refresh your game to see a grid appear on the screen, marking x and y positions every 100 pixels.
   - This grid is optional but can be very helpful in placing game items more precisely.

3. **Using Comments to Toggle the Grid**
   - You can easily enable or disable the grid by commenting out the `toggleGrid()` function call.
   - Use the **shortcut** `Ctrl + /` (Windows) or `Cmd + /` (Mac) to quickly add or remove `//` from the beginning of the line.

## **TODO 2:** Add _Platforms_

🎯 **Goal:** Add platforms to your game for the player to jump on and navigate the level.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 🔍 **Locate the section in your code** where you can add platforms.

   - Add your code below the comment that says `// TODO 2 - Create Platforms`
   - You’ll be using the `createPlatform` function to set the position and size of each platform.

2. **Understand the Arguments for `createPlatform`**
   - The `createPlatform` function requires several arguments to specify where each platform appears and its dimensions.
   - Refer to the table below to understand each argument’s purpose:

   <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">

| Argument | Description                                                             | Example Value        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `x`      | x-coordinate of the platform                                            | `500`                |
| `y`      | y-coordinate of the platform                                            | `300`                |
| `width`  | Width of the platform in pixels                                         | `200`                |
| `height` | Height of the platform in pixels                                        | `20`                 |
| `color`  | (Optional) Color of the platform; will default to grey if not specified | `"hotpink"`          |

   </div>

Example function calls:

```javascript
createPlatform(500, 0, 20, 290);
createPlatform(1350, 400, 50, 50, "red");
```

<br>

3. **Add at least 5 platforms** in your game by calling `createPlatform` with different arguments.
   - **Create a new line for each platform**: To add multiple platforms, you’ll need to call createPlatform separately on a new line for each one. Each platform should have its own line of code with its own specific x, y, width, and height values.
   - Remember, the y-axis is inverted in 2D graphics, so larger `y` values move platforms lower on the screen.

---

### 🎨 Tip: Use Color to Track Your Progress!

As you're adding and positioning platforms, it can be really helpful to change their colors *after* they're in the right place.

This way, you can quickly spot which platforms are already finished and which ones you're still working on. It's a great habit for staying organized while building.

In your `createPlatform()` call, you can change the fill color by updating the last parameter. For example:

```js
createPlatform(100, 20, 10, 10, "lime"); // bright green for a finished platform
```

> You can leave the color parameter blank to use the default grey color while figuring out the desired position of your platform. Once you’re happy with the placement, change the color to something else to make it clear that it is finished.

      ⚙️ <strong>Use trial and error!</strong> Platforms might not land perfectly on the first try. Adjust the arguments (x, y, width, height) until you’re satisfied with the setup.
      <br><br>
      🪜 <strong>Work from the bottom up</strong>: Place your first platforms near the bottom of the game area. Building upward makes it easier to create a path the player can jump between.
    </td>
  </tr>

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 3:** Add _Collectables_

🎯 **Goal:** Add items (collectables) for the player to gather while navigating the game.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 🔍 **Locate the section in your code** designated for adding collectables.

   - Use the `createCollectable` function to add items at specific locations on the screen.

2. **Understand the Arguments for `createCollectable`**

   - The `createCollectable` function requires arguments that control the item’s type and position.
   - Refer to the table below for details:

   <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">

   | Argument  | Description                                                             | Example Value |
   | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
   | `type`    | The type of collectable (e.g., "database", "diamond")                          | `"diamond"`      |
   | `x`       | x-coordinate of the collectable                                         | `200`         |
   | `y`       | y-coordinate of the collectable                                         | `170`         |
   | `gravity` | (Optional) Controls how the item falls; set to `0` if it shouldn’t fall | `0.5`         |
   | `bounce`  | (Optional) Controls how much the item bounces when it lands             | `0.7`         |

   </div>

   **Important**: You can use any of the following values for your `type`: `"database"`, `"diamond"`, `"grace"`, `"kennedi"`, `"max"`, and `"steve"`

   ---

   Example function calls:

   ```javascript
   createCollectable("steve", 1350, 50);
   createCollectable("diamond", 200, 170, 0.5, 0.7);
   ```

<br>

3. **Add at least 3 collectables** at different positions throughout your game. Use different `type` values to add variety.

---

<table style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 15px; background-color: #2c2c2c; border: 1px solid #444; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden;">

    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 10px; color: #e2e2e2;">
      💎 <strong>Experiment with positioning</strong>: Test different x and y values to place items at reachable spots. Adjust as needed so that the collectables are accessible.<br><br>
      🔄 <strong>Use gravity and bounce carefully</strong>: These are optional values. Start with <code>0</code> if you want a stationary item, and increase them slightly to add movement or challenge. Using <code>1</code> for both values will make your object bounce to the same height each time.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- **Preview your game** in Live Server to ensure the collectables appear where you expect them.
- Make sure you have at least 3 collectables, with different types if possible.

## **TODO 4:** Add _Cannons_

🎯 **Goal:** Add cannons to your game to introduce obstacles for the player.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 🔍 **Locate the section in your code** for adding cannons.

   - Use the `createCannon` function to place each cannon along the screen edges.

2. **Understand the Arguments for `createCannon`**

   - The `createCannon` function has arguments for placement and firing speed. Review the table for details:

   <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">

   | Argument   | Description                                                     | Example Value |
   | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
   | `side`     | Which side of the screen to place the cannon (left, right, top) | `"left"`      |
   | `position` | Position along the side (distance from top or left)             | `300`         |
   | `delay`    | Time in milliseconds between shots                              | `2000`        |

   </div>

   **Important**: You can use any of the following string values for your `side`: `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`
   
  
   --- 

   Example function calls:

   ```javascript
   createCannon("top", 200, 100);
   createCannon("right", 300, 2000);
   ```

<br>

3. **Add at least 3 cannons** on different sides of the screen. Adjust their positions and delays to vary the difficulty.

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 6:** *Go Live*

🎯 **Goal:** Push your changes to GitHub and make your platformer game go live.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Ensure the grid is not visible**
   - If you used the grid to help build your game, make sure you disable it before saving your work. The grid is a tool for developers to place items accurately, but it can distract people (or dogs) who are playing your game.
   - To remove the grid, find the `toggleGrid()` function call underneath the `// TODO 1 - Enable the Grid` comment. Add two slashes (`//`) in front of the `toggleGrid` function call to disable that line of code.

2. **Open the terminal in your codespace**
   - If the terminal isn’t visible, click the **Hamburger Menu > Terminal > New Terminal**.

3. **Run the required git commands one by one** in the terminal, pressing enter after each command to run it. Reference the table and comment below for how to run the three commands:

| Command              | Purpose                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git add .`          | Stages all your changes so Git is aware of them.             |
| `git commit -m "Finalized platformer game"`      | Saves a version of your work with a brief message.           |
| `git push`           | Uploads your committed changes to GitHub, making them live.  |

<br>

4. **Wait a few minutes for the changes to go live at your-username.github.io.**

---

<br>

### ✅ **Check Your Work!**

- Visit the site `your-github-username.github.io` to see your platformer game live on the internet.
  - Make sure to replace the text `"your-github-username"` with your actual github username when entering the URL in your browser.
- Navigate to your Platformer link on your Portfolio page to ensure it is live on the web.
  - You might need to refresh your page for your changes to appear.
